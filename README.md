# YelpDataChallenge

The data was obtained as a part of Yelp Dataset challenge in 2015.
The goal of the project was to use the data available to help create a restaurant business. I sought to answer the basic questions  the such as Where? What? Why and how? Since Yelp dataset provided a sneak peek into the US dining preference, I decided that I could use it as sort of competitive intelligence to gather what attributes made successful business successful and what did not.

Insights:

Where? : Since Vegas was the popular tourist destination in the US and provided steady influx of tourist looking to try out new things, I decided to focus on finding a spot within the city. Since the Yelp dataset consisted of a dataset of people's check-in into business, I used that to find out popular dining areas. I accomplished this by created a filter which filtered out business with less than 3 star rating and less than 1000 check-in and visualized it. From the map it was clear Vegas strip is the popular dining areas in town.

 What?: Once the spot is decided next step was to identify people's eating preference in Vegas. Are they willing to spend time to enjoy the cuisine as in case of buffet ? Or most people looking to just grab n go as with fast foods?. To answer this question I turned the attention to categories in check-ins. Buffet ( followed coffee, sushi, dessert etc.) were the most popular and highly rated compared to others in our dataset
 
Why?  to identify what other attributes influenced a customer's rating other than food quality and service. I studied the effects of various attributes in its rating. For the price range I was targeting I identified restaurants rating was better when they had full bar/ beer and wine. The other interesting thing we found was restaurants were actually rated better if they had no Wi-Fi compared to having paid Wi-Fi. Which in retrospect makes sense. 

How? Once we identified the restaurant location, its category and attributes, the only remaining to answer is How to promote it? Though Vegas guarantees steady stream of tourist, people still use discovery apps such as Yelp to find the place, we need influencers to sway the people towards the new establishment. So we decided to identify top influencers in the area. Influencers who had most number of fans, number of times reviews were voted useful, cool, funny were weighted high to identify top influencers and invite them for business promotion.
